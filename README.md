# Machine-learning-assignments
## Assignment 12 - Version 3

This assignment focuses on advanced machine learning techniques, including:

- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation

The notebook `diamond_cut_quality.ipynb` contains detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help you understand and apply these concepts. This was part of M-Tech course work.

Used algorithms are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbour

Notebook also provides comprehensive Model comparison, Hyper-parameter tunnning.
